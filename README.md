# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart disease cases are rising at an alarming rate, and it's critical to be able to predict these diseases in advance. The project focuses on predicting which patients are more likely to have heart disease based on a variety of medical factors. To predict and identify patients with heart disease, we used different algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forest, and KNN. The proposed model's accuracy was quite good, and it was able to predict signs of heart disease in a person. This heart disease predictive method improves patient treatment and makes diagnosing the disease easier along with allowing exploring large data at once.
We collected the dataset from Kaggle to train the model. The data was gathered from multiple instances. The database is taken from the UCI repository. It initially had 76 attributes but a subset of 14 attributes was used. The dataset includes a variety of individuals and their histories of heart disease, as well as other medical conditions. The dataset consists of the medical history of 1025 different patients of different attributes spread across. This dataset provides details about the patient's medical characteristics, such as age, chest pain types, blood pressure, sugar level, angina, and so on, which enables us in determining whether or not the patient has been diagnosed with heart disease.
